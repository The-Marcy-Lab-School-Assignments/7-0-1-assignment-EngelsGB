# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

1. We can omit the dependency array which will make the callback run every time the component re-renders.
2. We can pass an empty array as the dependency array which will make the callback run only once when the component renders for the first time.
3. We can pass an array with any amount of elements which will make the callback run when the value of the elements in the array change.
